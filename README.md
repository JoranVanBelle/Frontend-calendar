# Front-end Calendar web-app

To run the front-end of this Calendar web-app, you need to install yarn first and start it.
This by doing the steps below in the terminal.

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Common errors

If you want to run this front-end on your localhost, you need to make sure you downloaded and installed the backend as well.

## Visit website

If you want to have a quick look at my website,
I created an account using my email from school.
The url is: https://joranvanbellehogent.github.io/frontendweb-karine-2122-JoranVanBelleHoGent/
This are the credentials.
```
email: joran.vanbelle2@student.hogent.be
wachtwoord: 0123456789
```

You will start at the not found page, but there is a button to go to the loginscreen.

## recommendations

If you look at your phone/Ipad, it is recommended to hold it in landscape.
